# Handwritten Digit Recognition Project
## Project Introduction
This project aims to build a handwritten digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with PyTorch. The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) from images.
## Environment Dependencies
This project is based on Python 3.7 or higher. The following libraries are required:
PyTorch
Torchvision
NumPy
Matplotlib
To install the dependencies, run:
```pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib```
## Dataset
The project uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. The dataset can be easily loaded using Torchvision's torchvision.datasets.MNIST module.
Training and Validating the Model
## Training and test
To train the model, run the following command:
```python train.py```
After training,the script will do test automatically.
